This an experimental clone of the [2048 game](https://play2048.co/) using
[Nelua](https://github.com/edubart/nelua-lang) and
[Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/). Made mainly for checking out raylib in practice.

Raylib bindings from [raylib-nelua](https://github.com/Andre-LA/raylib-nelua-mirror) are used,
thanks to @Andre-LA.

## Running

You must have both Nelua and latest Raylib installed and working. At the moment
only Linux system is supported.

To run simple do `nelua -r game2048.nelua`
